# OpenWrt LuCI Theme: FoxHound (Beta)

A complete overhaul of the default OpenWrt LuCI Bootstrap theme – faster, cleaner, and ready for modern devices.  
This theme rebuilds the UI from the ground up while keeping the familiar Bootstrap core, then extends it with a professional dark dashboard, real‑time widgets, and a responsive mobile experience.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Complete CSS Rewrite  
- **`cascade.css`** fully refactored: removed legacy code, fixed browser inconsistencies, and optimised animation performance.  
- All UI components (buttons, tables, dropdowns, progress bars) now use modern CSS (Grid, Flexbox, custom properties) without breaking LuCI’s original logic.

### ✅ PassWall2 Full Compatibility  
- The theme automatically detects and styles **PassWall2** pages
- Rewritten forms, tables, and action buttons – all maintain perfect alignment with the theme’s dark palette.  
- No more broken layouts or annoying overflows; every PassWall2 element is polished for both desktop and mobile.

### ✅ Mobile Optimised

- New responsive breakpoints (`mobile.css`) ensure the interface works flawlessly on smartphones and tablets.  
- Touch‑friendly controls: larger buttons, reflowed tables (data‑title attributes), and a collapsible sidebar.  
- Tested on iOS, Android, and various screen sizes down to 320px.

### ✅ Easy Customisation  
- CSS custom properties (variables) are used throughout – change primary colours, border radius, shadows, or spacing in one place.  
- No need to edit every file: all theme variables are centralised in `palette.css`.

## How to Change the Theme Logo And Login Page Wallpaper 

### 🐦 Custom Logo

You can easily replace the logo with your own custom logo using one of two methods.

Method 1 : Edit the `header.ut` File

Locate and edit the `header.ut` file at:

/usr/share/ucode/luci/themplate/theme/foxhound

Inside this file, find the `<div>` with the class `left-head`. Look for the `<img>` tag and replace the `src` attribute with your own logo link:

```html
<img src="your-logo-link.png"></img>
````
Method 2 : Replace the SVG Logo File

If you prefer to keep the default filename, simply replace the existing SVG logo file at:

/www/luci-static/foxhound/resources/css/icons/svg/logo.svg

### 🖼️ Login Page Wallpaper

To set a custom background image for the login page, use the `palette.css` file.

Locate the following variable at the top of the file:

```css
--login-wallpaper: url(login.jpg);
```
set your own image link or place your custom `jpg` image file with the name `login` inside the `css` folder
